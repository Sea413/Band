      Rick Sanchez â€“ A genius scientist who is the father of Beth Smith, and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. His alcoholic tendencies lead his daughter's family to worry about the safety of their son Morty. The series is often retroscripted for Rick's lines. He displays "diagnosable qualities of various mental illnesses." An extremely intellectual character that views his time as valuable,[6] he eschews the usefulness of many ordinary human conventions such as school, marriage, and even love. His reaction to the mundane requests asked of him by Morty and other family members suggests he considers himself wholly superior to them, though in several instances throughout the series he shows a lonelier side. He frequently 'burp-talks' words in the middle of a sentence while speaking, presumably as a result of his alcoholism. He is identified as being the Rick of Dimension C-137.
